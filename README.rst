BrilliantImagery UI
===================

A basic user interface for the `BrilliantImagery <http://brilliantimagery.org>`_ Python package. It can do things such as render images to ensure that they're properly processed by the underlying engine, and smooth lighting and color transitions in DNG image sequences processed with Adobe Lightroom.


Running from Instillation from Source
-------------------------------------
Once the app is installed (see below), from within the top level ``/brilliantimagery_ui`` folder, run:

::

$ poetry run python brilliantimagery_ui/ui.py

Downloadable Executables
------------------------
Windows executables are available at `BrilliantImagery <http://brilliantimagery.org>`_

Hopefully MacOS executables will also be coming before too long.

Instillation from Source
------------------------

BrilliantImagery_UI relys on `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and the `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_ package and dependency manager. Install them both if you haven't already done so.

Clone the `git repo <https://github.com/brilliantimagery/brilliantimagery_ui.git>`_.

From within the top ``/brilliantimagery_ui`` folder, the one that contains the ``pyproject.toml`` file, install BrilliantImagery_UI:

::

$ poetry install

Package Into A Single Executable
--------------------------------

Once BrilliantImagery_UI is installed, the standard executable can be generated by running:

::

$ poetry run pyinstaller ui.spec

Depending on the method that you use, the output will either be put into a ``/output`` or ``/dist`` folder.

Alternatively, if a custom executable configuration is desired, open a poetry shell from within the top level ``/brilliantimagery_ui`` folder.

::

$ poetry shell

Now a custom configuration can by generated by either running the ``pyinstaller`` command (which is beyond the scop of this README) or with the ``auto-py-to-exe`` tool by running:

::

$ auto-py-to-exe
